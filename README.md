# NaiveBayesPresentation
Data Science from Scratch -- tutorial covering Naive Bayes (chapter 13)


The goal of the notebook is to understand the Naive Bayes classifier found in chapter 13 of 'Data Science from Scratch' by Joel Grus. This project is creating a baby spam filter using the data from the SpamAssassin Public Corpus. https://spamassassin.apache.org/publiccorpus/

To help familiarize with concepts and notation, there are some problems at the beginning that can be done 'by hand.' 

At the end of this notebook, there is a brief discussion of the distributions commonly used with Naive Bayes, and a small reference to one with a Guassian normal distribution to provide contrast.
