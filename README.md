# NaiveBayesPresentation
'Data Science from Scratch' tutorial covering Probability (chapter 6) and Naive Bayes (chapter 13)

[WiDS_Probability.ipynb](WiDS_Probability.ipynb) (author @jess010) contains a series of probability questions that cover basic probability, permutations and combinations, and dependence and independence.

[WiDS_NaiveBayes.ipynb](WiDS_NaiveBayes.ipynb) (author @juliathebrave) works up to understanding the Naive Bayes classifier found in chapter 13 of 'Data Science from Scratch' by Joel Grus. The project creates a baby spam filter using the data from the [SpamAssassin Public Corpus] (https://spamassassin.apache.org/publiccorpus/).

The [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ac2BtZBMJGeaMGwshM8ZD58NQN7V_Nh9E4cM9HSios0/edit?usp=sharing) (authors @elisaF, @jess010, and @juliathebrave) contains links to additional resources.
